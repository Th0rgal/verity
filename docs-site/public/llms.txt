# Dumb Contracts Documentation

> Minimal Lean EDSL for Smart Contracts

## About

Dumb Contracts is a research project exploring minimalism in smart contract language design. The result is an 82-line Lean 4 core that handles realistic token contracts through pattern composition.

## Quick Access

## API Routes

GET /api/docs/_index     - List all documents (JSON)
GET /api/docs/_all       - All docs concatenated (Markdown)
GET /api/docs/[page]     - Single document (Markdown)

## Design Principles

1. Example-Driven Development - Only add what examples need
2. Composition Over Complexity - Patterns compose naturally
3. Type Safety First - Catch errors at compile-time
4. Minimal Core - Extensions through stdlib, not core
5. Semantic Alignment - Match Solidity behavior

## Pattern Library

1. SimpleStorage - Basic state management
2. Counter - Fast arithmetic
3. SafeCounter - Checked arithmetic
4. Owned - Access control
5. OwnedCounter - Pattern composition
6. Ledger - Mapping storage
7. SimpleToken - Token contract
