# Dumb Contracts Documentation

> Minimal Lean 4 EDSL for Smart Contracts with Formal Verification

## About

Dumb Contracts combines minimalism with mathematical rigor: an 82-line Lean 4 core that handles realistic smart contracts, backed by machine-checked formal proofs of correctness.

**From runtime testing to mathematical proof**

## Quick Access

- Complete documentation: /api/docs/_all
- Documentation index: /api/docs/_index
- Formal verification: /verification.md
- Research log: /research.md
- Examples: /examples.md
- Core architecture: /core.md

## Key Stats

- Core: 82 lines
- Examples: 7 contracts
- Runtime tests: 62 (100% passing)
- Fuzz runs: 2,816
- **Proven theorems: 11 (SimpleStorage)**

## Documentation Format

All pages support:
- HTML rendering (browser)
- Raw markdown (add .md extension or ?format=md)
- Auto-detection for AI user agents

## Design Principles

1. Minimalism - 82-line core, only essentials
2. Rigor - Separation of specs, implementations, and proofs
3. Incremental Verification - Start simple, build up complexity
4. Type Safety First - Catch errors at compile-time
5. Practicality - Real contracts with both runtime tests and formal proofs

## Contracts & Verification Status

1. **SimpleStorage** - Basic state management (✅ 11 theorems proven)
2. **Counter** - Fast arithmetic (🔄 Verification next)
3. **SafeCounter** - Checked arithmetic
4. **Owned** - Access control (🔜 Verification planned)
5. **OwnedCounter** - Pattern composition
6. **Ledger** - Mapping storage
7. **SimpleToken** - Token contract (🔜 Complex invariants planned)
