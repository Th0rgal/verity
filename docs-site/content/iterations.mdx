# Iteration Summaries

This page provides detailed summaries of each iteration in the Dumb Contracts development process.

## Iteration 7: Simple Token Contract

[Full Summary →](/iterations/iteration-7)

**Goal**: Create a realistic token contract combining Owned and Ledger patterns

**Key Achievement**: Pattern composition with mappings validated

- Combined Owned (access control) + Ledger (balances mapping)
- Owner-controlled minting, public transfers
- **Zero core changes needed** (uses existing primitives)
- 12 new tests, all passing (62 total)

**Metrics**:
- Core: 82 lines (unchanged)
- SimpleToken: ~100 lines
- Tests: 62/62 passing

---

## Iteration 6: Mapping Support

[Full Summary →](/iterations/iteration-6)

**Goal**: Add mapping support (Address → Uint256) for key-value storage

**Key Achievement**: First core extension in 3 iterations

- Added `storageMap` field to ContractState
- Ledger example demonstrating balances mapping
- Core grew from 69 → 82 lines (+19%)
- 11 new tests, all passing (50 total)

**Why This Extension**:
- Enables entire class of token contracts
- No alternative approach
- Minimal addition (13 lines)

---

## Iteration 5: Math Safety Stdlib

[Full Summary →](/iterations/iteration-5)

**Goal**: Add checked arithmetic operations via stdlib

**Key Achievement**: Extensibility validated

- Created Math.lean stdlib (63 lines)
- safeAdd, safeSub, safeMul, safeDiv
- **Core unchanged** (69 lines)
- 9 new tests, all passing (39 total)

**Pattern Established**: Stdlib extends without core changes

---

## Iteration 4: OwnedCounter

[Full Summary →](/iterations/iteration-4)

**Goal**: Validate pattern composition

**Key Achievement**: Composability proven

- Combined Owned + Counter patterns
- **Core unchanged** (72 lines)
- 11 new tests, all passing (30 total)

**Insight**: Patterns compose without special support

---

## Iteration 3: Owned Pattern

[Full Summary →](/iterations/iteration-3)

**Goal**: Add access control and ownership

**Key Achievement**: Address storage added

- Owner-controlled operations
- onlyOwner modifier pattern
- Core grew from 58 → 72 lines (+24%)
- 8 new tests, all passing (19 total)

**Why This Extension**:
- Concrete need for access control
- Type-safe Address storage

---

## Iteration 2: Counter

[Full Summary →](/iterations/iteration-2)

**Goal**: Validate arithmetic operations

**Key Achievement**: Namespace strategy established

- Increment/decrement operations
- **Core unchanged** (58 lines)
- 7 new tests, all passing (11 total)

**Decision**: Keep core minimal, defer safety to stdlib

---

## Iteration 1: Bootstrap

[Full Summary →](/iterations/iteration-1)

**Goal**: Establish minimal core

**Key Achievement**: 58-line functional EDSL

- Basic Ethereum types
- StorageSlot abstraction
- StateM monad for contracts
- SimpleStorage example
- 4 tests, all passing

**Foundation**: Type-safe storage with minimal primitives

---

## Core Growth Analysis

| Iteration | Core Lines | Change | Reason |
|-----------|------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | 58 | +58 | Bootstrap |
| 2 | 58 | +0 | No change needed |
| 3 | 72 | +14 | Address storage |
| 4 | 72 | +0 | Composition works |
| 5 | 69 | -3 | Cleanup |
| 6 | 82 | +13 | Mapping storage |
| 7 | 82 | +0 | Composition works |

**Key Insight**: 4 out of 7 iterations with zero core changes validates the composability approach.
