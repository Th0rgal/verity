# Compiler Artifacts

This folder collects compiler artifacts and fixtures used by tests and documentation.

## Contents

- `compiler/yul/`: Generated Yul output used by Foundry tests and differential testing.
- Generated by the Lean compiler: `lake exe verity-compiler` (output defaults to `compiler/yul/`).

## Related Source

- Compiler implementation: `Compiler/`
- Proofs: `Compiler/Proofs/`
- Tests: `test/` (Foundry unit, property, and differential tests)

## Assumptions

Yul is compiled to bytecode using `solc` (trusted), and the runtime semantics are modeled in Lean. See:

- Yul semantics: `Compiler/Proofs/YulGeneration/Semantics.lean`
- Codegen correctness: `Compiler/Proofs/YulGeneration/Preservation.lean`
